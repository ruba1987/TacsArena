TacsArena
=========

TacsArena (Tactical Arena) is an extension of the [BattleArena](http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/battlearena/) and [CaptureTheFlag](http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/arenactf/) plugins. This plugin does not require [CaptureTheFlag](http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/arenactf/) but it does use a fair amount of the code; it does require [BattleArena](http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/battlearena/). The aim of this project is to provide a fun long term tactical game with more than one way to score.
